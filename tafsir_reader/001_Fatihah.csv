Al Fatihah was called the Salah, because reciting it is a condition for the correctness of Salah the prayer Al Fatihah was also called Ash-Shifa' (the Cure) It is also called Ar Ruqyah (remedy) since in the Sahih, there is the narration of Abu Sa id telling the story of the Companion who used Al Fatihah as a remedy for the tribal chief who was poisoned.

However, Ar Razi recorded that Ata' bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti adhah is required ; in the prayer and when one reads the Quran In support of Ata's  statement Ar-Razi relied UDon the apparent meaning 0f the Ayah, فاستعة ( Then seek refuge) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation , Also, the Prophet always said the Isti adhah  In addition  the Isti adhah wards off the evil of Satan which is necessary; the rule is that the means needed to implement requirement 0f the religion i5 itself also required  And when one says, ""I seek with Allah from the cursed devil.

It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. 19 refuge"
001_Fatihah_page_19.png," Further , the Isti adhah entails seeking Allah's help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti adhah also affirms the servants meekness weakness and inability to face the enemy of  his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy is able t0 repel and defeat  This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy There are three Ayat in the Quran that affirms this fact Also, Allah said  إن عبادى ليس لك عليهم سلطن وكفى بربك وكيلا Verily, M٧ servants (i.e the true believers 0f Islamic Monotheism ) you have no authority over them  And sufficient is your Lord 45 Guardian (17:65) We should state here that the believers  whom the human enemies  kill, become martyrs, while  those who fall victim to the inner enemy Satan become bandits  Further , the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy disbelievers gain reward while those defeated by the inner  enemy earn sin and become misguided Since Satan sees man where man cannot see it i5 befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see The Isti adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking with Him from the evil 0f every evil creature  What does Isti  adhah Isti adhah means, ""I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from  affecting my religious ٥٢ worldly affairs  0٢ hindering me from   adhering t0 what was commanded 0٢ luring me into what Wa5 prohibited from 20 him, refuge Mean"

(7:199) This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah وإمًا ينزغثك من الشئًيطن نزع فاستعد باللًه إنه سميع عليم And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan  then seek with Allah  Verily, He is Hearing  Knowing  (7: 200) Allah also said in Surah AI-Mu'minun اذفع بالتى هى أحسن السيئًة نحن أعلم بمًا يصفون وقل رب أعود بك من همزات الشًيطين وأعودبك رب أن يحضرون Repel evil with that which i5 better  We are Best- Acquainted with the things utter And say Lord! seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions ) 0f the Shayatin ( devils ).

Verily, He is the Hearing the Knowing. (41:34-36) Why the Devil is called Shaytan In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana which means the far thing   Hence, the Shaytan has different nature than mankind, and his   sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness It was also said that; Shaytan i5 derived from   Shata, (literally burned') because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct  although they state that the first   meaning i5 more plausible Further  Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic ) said, ""The Arabs say So-and-so has Tashaytan, when he commits the act of the devils  If Shaytan was derived from Shata  they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan) 22 الذى"
001_Fatihah_page_22.png," Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means  far away This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous ) from among the Jinns and mankind Shaytan' Allah said كذلك جعلنا لكل نبئ عدووا شيطين الإنس والجن يوحى بعضهم إلى بعض زخرف القول غرورا And S0 We have appointed for every Prophet enemies Shayatin   ( devils ) among mankind and Jinn    inspiring one another with adorned speech as delusion (or by way of deception). (6:112) In   addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records   that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said, يًا أبًا ذر تعوًد بالله من شياطين الإنس والجن Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns Abu Dharr said, I asked him, Are there human devils?'
